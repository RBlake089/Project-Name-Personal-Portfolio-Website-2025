          I am an aspiring front-end web developer with a passion for coding.
          For me, coding is like solving intricate puzzles, and I find immense
          satisfaction in overcoming challenges and finding solutions. This
          portfolio is a showcase of my journey and growth in web development,
          and it will continue to evolve as I refine my skills and take on new
          projects.

          I am known for being a fun and engaging individual to work with. I
          hold a certificate in Full-Stack Web Development from the University
          of Central Florida, which has prepared me to embark on a rewarding
          career in web development. Additionally, I have a background in 3D
          artistry, holding a degree in Computer Animation, which complements my
          technical skills with a creative edge.
