      <p>
        I am an aspiring front-end web developer with a passion for coding.
        For me, coding is like solving intricate puzzles, and I find immense
        satisfaction in overcoming challenges and finding solutions. This
        portfolio is a showcase of my journey and growth in web development,
        and it will continue to evolve as I refine my skills and take on new
        projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am known for being a fun and engaging individual to work with. I
        hold a certificate in Full-Stack Web Development from the University
        of Central Florida, which has prepared me to embark on a rewarding
        career in web development. Additionally, I have a background in 3D
        artistry, holding a degree in Computer Animation, which complements my
        technical skills with a creative edge.
      </p>
      <p>
        This portfolio reflects my dedication to continuous learning and my
        commitment to excellence in every project I undertake.
